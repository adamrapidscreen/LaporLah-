# E10-S6: Write README.md and Environment Configuration

## Description
Create a comprehensive README.md with project overview, feature list, tech stack, setup instructions, seed data guide, deployment steps, and assumptions. Also create `.env.local.example` with all required environment variables documented.

## Dependencies
- Stories: E1-S1 (project initialized)
- Files: `package.json`

## Tasks
1. `README.md`: Create project documentation with:
   - Project name "LaporLah!" and tagline "Komuniti Pantau, Komuniti Baiki"
   - Feature list (reporting, status tracking, community verification, gamification, admin dashboard)
   - Tech stack table (Next.js 15, Supabase, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui, Leaflet, TypeScript)
   - Prerequisites (Node.js 18+, npm, Supabase account)
   - Setup steps: clone, install, environment variables, Supabase project setup, database migrations, run dev
   - Seed data instructions (npm run seed)
   - Deployment to Vercel instructions
   - Project structure overview
   - Screenshot placeholders
   - Assumptions and limitations section
2. `.env.local.example`: Create example environment file with all required variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
   - `ADMIN_USER_ID`
   - Comments explaining each variable

## Implementation Notes

### README Structure
```markdown
# 🇲🇾 LaporLah!

> Komuniti Pantau, Komuniti Baiki — Community-driven issue reporting for Malaysia

## Features
- Report infrastructure issues with photos and location
- Track report status from open to resolved
- Community verification with voting system
- Gamification with points, streaks, and badges
- Admin dashboard for content moderation
- Bilingual support (Malay/English)

## Tech Stack
| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Next.js 15 | Framework (App Router, RSC) |
| TypeScript | Type safety |
| Supabase | Database, Auth, Storage, Realtime |
| Tailwind CSS 4 | Styling |
| shadcn/ui | UI components |
| Leaflet | Maps |
| Zod | Validation |
| @serwist/next | PWA support |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm
- Supabase account (free tier)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Copy environment file: `cp .env.local.example .env.local`
4. Fill in Supabase credentials (see Environment Variables below)
5. Set up Supabase: enable Google OAuth, create Storage bucket "report-photos"
6. Run database migrations in Supabase SQL editor
7. Seed the database: `npm run seed`
8. Start development server: `npm run dev`

## Environment Variables
See `.env.local.example` for the full list.

## Deployment
Deploy to Vercel with Supabase integration...

## Assumptions & Limitations
- Designed for Malaysian context
- Mobile-first PWA, functional on desktop
- Google OAuth only (no email/password)
- No push notifications (in-app bell only)
- No offline write/creation
- Location permission mandatory for report creation
```

### Environment File
```bash
# .env.local.example

# Supabase Configuration
# Get these from your Supabase project dashboard → Settings → API
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://laporlah.vercel.app

# Admin User
# Set this to your Google UID from the Supabase Auth dashboard
# This user will have admin role after running the seed script
ADMIN_USER_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```
