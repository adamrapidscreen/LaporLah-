# E10-S6: Write README.md and Environment Configuration

## Description
Create a comprehensive README.md with project overview, feature list, tech stack, setup instructions, seed data guide, deployment steps, and assumptions. Also create `.env.local.example` with all required environment variables documented.

## Dependencies
- Stories: E1-S1 (project initialized)
- Files: `package.json`

## Tasks
1. `README.md`: Create project documentation with:
   - Project name "LaporLah!" and tagline "Community-driven issue reporting for Malaysia"
   - Feature list (reporting, status tracking, community verification, gamification, admin dashboard)
   - Tech stack table (Next.js 15, Supabase, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui, Leaflet, TypeScript)
   - Prerequisites (Node.js 18+, npm, Supabase account)
   - Setup steps: clone, install, environment variables, Supabase project setup, database migrations, run dev
   - Seed data instructions (npm run seed)
   - Deployment to Vercel instructions
   - Project structure overview
   - Screenshot placeholders
   - Assumptions and limitations section
2. `.env.local.example`: Create example environment file with all required variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - Comments explaining each variable

## Implementation Notes

### README Structure
```markdown
# 🇲🇾 LaporLah!

> Community-driven issue reporting platform for Malaysia

## Features
- Report infrastructure issues with photos and location
- Track report status from open to resolved
- Community verification with voting system
- Gamification with points, streaks, and badges
- Admin dashboard for content moderation
- Bilingual support (Malay/English)

## Tech Stack
| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Next.js 15 | Framework (App Router, RSC) |
| TypeScript | Type safety |
| Supabase | Database, Auth, Storage |
| Tailwind CSS 4 | Styling |
| shadcn/ui | UI components |
| Leaflet | Maps |
| Zod | Validation |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm
- Supabase account

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Copy environment file: `cp .env.local.example .env.local`
4. Fill in Supabase credentials
5. Run database migrations
6. Seed the database: `npm run seed`
7. Start development server: `npm run dev`

## Deployment
Deploy to Vercel with Supabase integration...

## Assumptions & Limitations
- Designed for Malaysian context
- Single-language UI (Malay with some English)
- No real-time notifications (polling-based)
- Map limited to Malaysia region
```

### Environment File
```bash
# .env.local.example

# Supabase Configuration
# Get these from your Supabase project dashboard → Settings → API
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
```
